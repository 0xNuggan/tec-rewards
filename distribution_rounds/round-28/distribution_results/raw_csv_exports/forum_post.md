# TEC Rewards Distribution - round-28  - 30/01/23 to 04/02/23
This period covers praise given between **30 January 2023 and 04 February 2023**. We allocated **1874.0** TEC tokens for rewards, with a **100:0** split between Praise and Sourcecred. Some praise accounts still havenâ€™t been activated so the total amount below will be less than what we set aside to distribute.

Out of the total rewards:

* 90% of the tokens were given as praise rewards :pray:
* 7% distributed among quantifiers :balance_scale:
* 3% assigned to the reward board :memo:

This data has been reviewed by the Quantifiers and the Reward Board, and has been submitted for distribution to the [Reward Board DAO](https://xdai.aragon.blossom.software/#/rewardboardtec/)


You can check out the [full period analysis here](ADD LINK HERE). :bar_chart:

This post will be open to the community for review for 48 hours then submitted to the Reward Board for final execution. :heavy_check_mark:
